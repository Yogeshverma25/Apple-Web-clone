# Apple-Web-clone

"This is a responsive and visually appealing clone of the official Apple website, created using only HTML and CSS. It includes a stylish layout, modern fonts, and clean design elements. The website adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly on both mobile and desktop devices. It's a great front-end project to showcase design and layout skills without using JavaScript."
